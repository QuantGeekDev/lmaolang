# 📚 Documentation:

👏 Use emojis to write html. Text is treated as text - but don't mention "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Name...

And sigh... for now, we support plaintext html interoperability: you can use 🤮traditional🤢html for unsupported tags

💀 Is the universal closing tag. Close any tag by adding the 💀 modifier to it.
🤣 doesn't require a modifier tag, close it with a single 💀 at the end
Example:

```
🤣 🪬 🫦 I love LmaoLang! 💀🫦 💀🪬 💀🤣
```
