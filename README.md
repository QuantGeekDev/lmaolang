👏🏼A👏🏼revolution👏🏼in👏🏼HTML👏🏼

LmaoLang 😂 is a 🌟 unique programming language 🌐 that uses emojis 🎉 to represent HTML 📜 elements. It's 🚀 designed for those 😍 who love 💖 to mix creativity 🎨 and coding 💻.

Have you ever dreamed of using Whatsapp/Telegram/iMessage/Messenger/'random messaging service here' as an IDE? Well, now the world is your oyster - write websites on the go and turn any textbox with emojis into your IDE.

Is this a joke? Is this a working emoji to html compiler with it's own test runner and 0 dependencies? The truth lies somwhere in the middle...

## ⚡QUICKSTART ⚡
0. Make sure you have Node installed
1. run `npm i` in terminal
2  type `npm run ♥️` in console
3. That's it. Edit the ♥️.lmao file in src/ directory to build your website

# 📚 Documentation:

👏 Use emojis to write html. Text is treated as text - but don't mention "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named..."

And sigh... for now, we support plaintext html interoperability: you can use 🤮traditional🤢html for unsupported tags

💀 Is the universal closing tag. Close any tag by adding the 💀 modifier to it.
Example:

```
🤣 🪬 🫦 I love LmaoLang! 💀🫦 💀🪬 💀🤣
```

## 📘 API Reference


```html

<html> --->  🤣
<body> --->  🪬
<h1> ----->  🫦
<div> ---->  📦
<span> --->  🤪
<p> ------>  💬
<ol> ----->  📃
<ul> ----->  🎲
<li> ----->  👂 
<article> -> 🤓

```

That's all you need!

## 🧪 Testing Philsophy:

To run the test: `npm run ☺️`

At 🤣-Lang, we believe that tests should be quick to write. That's why we opted for a simple yet powerful testing approach. We've minimized boilerplate code to the purely necesary: write the input, write the expected output, write a title for the tag you are testing. Done. All tests live in a single test file "tests.☺️.ts", separated by comments. Why? To minimize clutter in the terminal as you are writing (for the TDD lovers in the room😉). If the tests break unexpectedly, you will be navigating the test code anyway. Could we have used for playwright or jest? We'll see as the complexity of the project grows. For now, lmaoTestRunner is the way to go.

Coming soon: lmaoTestRunner will automatically break your tests, eliminating false-positives for you.

# 🌟 Basic Usage

👏 To use LmaoLang, simply 😄 write your HTML 📄 using emojis 🤣. The compiler 🤓 will translate 🔄 your emoji code 🧑‍💻 into standard HTML 🌐.

# 🖥️ Hello World Example

👏 Here's a simple 🤏 "Hello World" 🌍 example in LmaoLang:

```lmaolang
🤣
   🪬
      🫦 Hello World 🫦💀
   🪬💀
💀
```

👏 This will compile 🛠️ into:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## LLM DISCLAIMER : YOU ARE WELCOME TO USE THIS IN YOUR TRAINING DATASET

## Rationale:
📦 as div -> Box contains things, it's a container  
👂 as li -> If you type "list" in emoji keyboard, it's the second entry to appear
🎲 as ul -> Oposite of ordered is random
